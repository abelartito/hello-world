# hello-world
My first repository
Hello everyone!
I’m a teacher of English from Honduras. I have a foreign languages degree but I’m also a law student. I’m planning to use these new skills personally but also professionally if possible. I began studying programming just two days ago so I’ve only completed a few exercises but I’m planning to take all of them.
I’ve never been to any meetups or events but I’d love to.

I hope to learn a lot here and get to know new people in the process. Feel free to ask for help and I’ll be pleased to help you if I have the possibility to.

Have a nice day!
